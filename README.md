# python_clock

## Introduction:

* This is a python clock I built with Kivy, which is a GUI framework. The UI/UX is very simple and not too complicated. 
* This is still a work in progress.
* Done as part of my project for Python. 

## How to use

* The clockNew.py is the file that runs the clock. If you have have kivy installed, you can run it using any version of Python3. I have not tested it for lower version of python. The gallery is static and has to be configured by you to display whatever images you want. I will commit the changes later on.
